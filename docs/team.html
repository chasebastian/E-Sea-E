            <img src="assets/kyle.jpg" width="100px">
            <p> I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering major primarily interested in embedded systems and robotics. I designed and prototyped the automatic feeder, worked on interrupt code for the RTC, and helped debug the entire system when we put everything together. I also designed and wrote both this website and the webapp used to interface with E Sea E. In my free time, I like playing and listening to music.</p>

            <p> I am a 4th year Electrical Engineer interested in Digital Design. I built and tested code for the RTC, Lights, Relay, Outlet, website (HTML, JS, Python), the Python Bluetooth communication code, and much of the system level integration code. Outside of school, you can catch me on the slopes! </p>
