        <h2> Problem </h2>
        <p> Home saltwater fishtank upkeep (including monitoring food, water, temperature, salinity, pH, etc) is so time consuming that it is intimidating for the average person to pick up. </p>
        <h2> Solution </h2>
        <p> We created a unified system that monitors different parameters in a fishtank simultaneously. An Arduino Uno monitors the temperature of the fish tank, activating a water heater if it gets too low. It also cycles the lights on and off once per day, and dispenses food pellets five times a day at regular intervals. All of these parameters and setpoints can be controlled via a web interface, which communicates with the Arduino via Bluetooth. </p>
        <h2> Process </h2>
        <p> Since our project was fairly modular, we worked on most of the individual components in parallel simultaneously. While some of our group members tested the temperature sensors, stepper motors, and real time clock module, others designed the automatic feeder in CAD and designed the web interface. Some preliminary CAD designs are shown below. </p>
